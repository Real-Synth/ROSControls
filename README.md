# ROSControls for Unreal Engine 4

This plugin enables control of wheeled vehicles via ROS messages.

In order to use this plugin you also need to add the [ROSIntegration Core Plugin](https://github.com/code-iai/ROSIntegration)  to your project.

## Usage
After installing this plugin and the core ROSIntegration plugin, you can load your UE4 project. If the plugin is not enabled in the project yet, you can do this in the UE4Editor in Edit -> Plugins.
When the plugin is loaded correctly, you should be able to select the AWheeledVehicleController as the Player Controller of the GameMode Settings of your level.
